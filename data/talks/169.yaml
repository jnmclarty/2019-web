talk_abstract: "For a Python developer, using PySpark may feel foreign, like driving a race car in sandals. This talk is about battle stories using PySpark from development to production, and how my many errors can lead to better code. In no particular order, I'll discuss speeding up development, avoiding 'friendly enemies' and testing code. You'll see how to avoid mistakes by seeing me making them, and you'll leave a more insightful PySpark developer."
