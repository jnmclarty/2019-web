    "talk_description": "The Python data science stack is composed of a rich set of powerful libraries that work wonderfully well together, providing coherent, beautiful, Pythonic APIs that let the Data Scientist think less about programming and more about the data.  However, many of these libraries are largely single-threaded (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-Learn), and as data workflows grow larger, they quickly run up against this limitation. RAPIDS is a suite of open-source libraries that provide APIs nearly identical to existing popular Python libraries. By leveraging the massively parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, RAPIDS libraries can provide speedups of 50x or more over their purely-CPU counterparts. [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) is a GPU DataFrame library following the Pandas API. [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml) is a GPU Machine Learning library following the Scikit-Learn API. [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) is a GPU Graph Analytics library with an API inspired by NetworkX. This talk will provide an overview of the RAPIDS ecosystem, with a focus on the cuDF library, its features and design. We'll show how cuDF combines the use of Numba, Cython, modern C++, CUDA, and Apache Arrow to build a highly performant DataFrame library that is also highly interoperable with other libraries in the PyData ecosystem. We'll show examples of workflows using cuDF both on a single GPU, and across multiple GPUs in conjunction with the Dask library. We'll also share some performance results, best practices, tips, and tricks.",

    "talk_description": "[PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2015/5k/) partnered with Autism Speaks in the year 2015 and conducted a 5K annual fun-run to raise awareness about Autism Spectrum Disorder. It’s great to see tech conferences supporting such a cause but wouldn’t it be incredible if we can leverage Python itself to understand autistic children and help them lead better lives? In this talk, we’ll cover the concepts of BioSensors, BioSignal Processing in Python and Machine Learning to find out how we can do just that. Since children suffering from ASD have difficulty in expressing and communicating, traditional methods of recognizing emotions through facial expressions or speech recognition tend to have very less accuracy. Hence, the technique of mapping emotions through physiological signals of the body using Biosignal Processing in Python is relatively new and un-explored which will be the basis of the talk. The talk aims to introduce various biosensors that can be used to capture the real-time physiological signals of the body, followed by the techniques involved in Biosignal processing using Python (Neurokit, BioSPPy) and finally conclude with explaining how Machine Learning algorithms like SVM and K-NN can help map these real-time signals to emotions.",

    "talk_description": "We've all seen beautiful data visualizations on the web and elsewhere. A good visualization can make a persuasive point or give new insights. How can you create beautiful and useful visualizations without too much effort? The secret behind each visualization is a set of well-organized data. In this case, we look at data from online surveys, which is not typically well-organized, and see how we can transform it and easily visualize it using the 'Grammer of Graphics' approach. The 'Grammer of Graphics' is a way of associating different data points and different aspects of a chart. You can provide the type of chart that you want, specify which data you want on the x and y axes and how you want to group you data and you will get a reasonable chart. As you do a data analysis, it is important to understand your data. A visualization tool that can quickly generate useful charts during analysis and also generate the finished charts for production is ideal. The `altair` package excels at both these jobs. The `altair` package allows you to create web ready visualizations using this approach using Python.\nThis talk will demonstrate how `altair` can be used with survey data to get quick insights out of a survey,or any other data source. `Altair` is built upon Vega and Vega-Lite, which are JavaScript libraries. They work well with Jupyter notebooks and are useful for data exploration. The data behind the chart and the code for the chart itself is stored as JSON\nand can be included on any web page, so the visualizations are independent of Python.",

What these articles often don’t cover is that at the beginning of your project, you'll be spending a lot of time collecting, cleaning and otherwise pre-processing your data, no matter what type of project or model you’re working on. There’s a tendency to dismiss this first stage as mundane, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. This first, exploratory, stage of the analysis is when you'll learn most about the information that is available for solving your problem and how to harness it. In this talk, I’ll use practical examples to describe some of the statistical techniques that I've found most useful over the years.

    "talk_description": "When most of us think of agriculture, we don't think of it as a cutting-edge playground for AI, robotics, and data science development in Python. Over the years with the development of Data Science and AI methodologies, people have potentially been interested in applying these tools to different fields(finance, journalism, agriculture) to gain meaningful insights. I came across a method called Hydroponics which allows growing plants with water in the absence of soil. I was deeply interested and started to question the idea of attaching a few sensors to plants.  Given the data, I began to explore the automation of the plant growth process. This talk focuses on performing exploratory data analysis and using neural networks with Python for implementing a smart and intelligent hydroponics system.",

    "talk_description": "There was a time that, no matter what language I was writing in, it always came out looking a little bit like FORTRAN. As I added on some OOP-ness and more modern languages, I eventually arrived at Python, a language which has a clear \"idiomatic\" style, and its own adjective. As it happens, I learned Python and Italian at the same time. I came to Python already working with Ruby, and I came to Italian already speaking French. These languages that are superficially similar have led me to some strange accidents, like asking at the Vatican if the bathrooms were stopped, and never, ever being able to write a for-each loop without looking up the syntax. What I realized is that it is hard to learn to speak like a native (or really at all) when you have nobody to talk to. People care about PEP8, but a computer will keep merrily running along and not tell you that your code looks weird. Also, no matter how many times I say the same sentence to Duolingo, it's just not the same as finding myself making a mistake in the middle of, \"I went to Rome last year,\" in my first conversation with an actual Italian. The following concepts will be touched on in this talk: The challenges of learning languages (spoken or programming) from an app, the benefits of letting the other languages languish while you pick up a new one, the importance of community (Exercism, Meetup, and the kindness of strangers) and the excitement of being able to talk about the weather.",

People may assume that a senior developer is experienced enough to not make any mistakes, or that merely changing those 3 lines of code couldn’t possibly do any harm to the system. In these cases, it’s not uncommon to skip the code review in order to cut some time. Unreviewed (or badly reviewed) code can be extremely dangerous, resulting in huge risks and unpredictable behavior. A survey says that, on average, developers spend 45% of their time fixing bugs and technical debt, when they could be developing new features instead. Defining simple guideline files, adopting certain behaviors and setting up repository configurations are steps that can increase manyfold the code review performance (in both time and quality). Using review tools both on server (e.g. Heroku Review Apps) and locally (e.g. linters) can also greatly increase the process’ speed. Creating templates and checklists ensures no step is overlooked or forgotten. The list goes on, but enough spoilers for now.

    "talk_description": "Ever got excited about a piece of new machine learning research that you saw come out on arXiv or your favorite research lab’s blog hoping it will finally solve that last bit of optimization you need in your own work that will make you the ML superstar of your team? But after spending days trying to get the same results, you end up failing despite having tried everything in the paper including looking through their Github page, contacting the authors, etc. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone! Everyday researchers and practitioners alike spend countless hours trying to replicate results from new ML research coming out but inevitably lose precious time and compute resources failing to achieve the required results. We’re facing a massive reproducibility crisis in the field of machine learning. There has been a rise in the ease of use of tools to develop machine learning (ML) based solutions, e.g. AutoML and Keras are two of many.  At the same time, there are a lot more public datasets available, aimed at socially oriented research. With more people entering the field coming from diverse trainings, it is not necessary that all adhere to rigorous standards of scientific research. This is evidenced by recent calls by the technical research community at conferences like NeurIPS. We see that a lack of reproducibility in ML research will be a key hindrance in meaningful use of R&D resources. There is currently a lack of a comprehensive framework for doing reproducible machine learning. We, as Pythonistas, can do something to help this! Through my own work in this domain and the work of the intern cohort that worked on the Reproducibility in Machine Learning project this summer at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, let’s talk through some of the social and technical aspects of this problem and how you can take these principles from the talk today and become the superhero of your ML team elevating the quality of the work coming from your team and helping others build on top of your work. We’ll walk through the following principles and apply them to a case study to understand how this simple yet effective mechanism can help address a ton of the issues that we face in the field.

    "title": "Query better with Django ORM",
    "talk_description": "Django ORM is extremely powerful and is a vital part of the framework. Being simple and intuitive to use, often some of its advanced features remain unutilized, leading to inefficiencies. In this cookbook style tutorial, a selection of nontrivial query usecases will be addressed, each of which will introduce an ORM feature or two. Notable ones covered will be advanced querying techniques, database functions, performance optimization, and legacy databases. In this interactive session, participants would be encouraged to share knowledge or ask questions based on their real-life challenges related to the topic at hand. The session will end with a discussion on ORM features recently introduced in Django as well as upcoming ones.",

    "title": "A need for speed: accelerating your math with vectorization and Numpy",
    "talk_description": "While Python is an extremely versatile language, it isn't exactly known for its blazing performance. When developing math-intensive applications, particularly on low-power devices such as single-board computers, this can become a real issue. This talk provides an introduction to vectorization and libraries designed to support it (such as Numpy), giving you the tools you need to eliminate those pesky for loops and achieve a drastic performance boost.",
